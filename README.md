# ProteinHeatStability_AI
Predicting heat stability of plant proteins using 3D structural features and AI.
A web-based AI tool to **predict the thermal stability of plant proteins based on 3D structural features and pre-trained embeddings.

Project Summary
This project performs the classification of plant proteins into Heat-Stable or Heat-Sensitive using only structure-based features extracted from .PDB files. Its application can be seen for agricultural genomics and climate resilience research.

 How It Works
Load a .PDB file of the protein.
Identify structural features (Salt Bridges, H-Bonds, Hydrophobicity, etc).
Use a trained classifier to predict heat stability using ML.
Results with confidence scores and visual graphs are shown.

 Key Features
No need for gene expression or experimental data.
Utilizes AlphaFold 3D structures.
Simplicity-oriented Stream
